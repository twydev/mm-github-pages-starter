This book contains a set of rules on writing to help writers feel more confident in writing for a wider audience. I like how the book provides examples to help readers better understand the application of each rule and how adopting the rules leads to better writing style.

**The Elements of Style** - W. Strunk Jr. & E. B. White
{: .notice--primary}

## Elementary Rules of Usage

1. **(Peter's. Charles's) Use 's for possessive singular of nouns.** Exceptions are ancient proper names and pronominal prossessives hers, its, theirs, yours, and oneself. 
2. **(Apple, Banana, and Chiku) For series of terms with conjunction, use comma after the terms except for the last.** etc. is always preceeded by a comma.
3. **(This dude, who was indifferent, became more interested) Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.** Applies to non-restrictive clauses introduced by which, when, where, who. Restrictive relative clauses do not require the commas. Example: The dude who is most interested will get the position.
4. **(Something something happened, but another thing also happened) Place a comma before introducing an independent clause**
5. **(This dude is cool; he was a former ninja) Do not join independent clauses by a comma.** Use a semicolon to form a compound sentence if necessary.
6. **(This is. An apple) Do NOT break sentences in two**
7. **(Being in a dilapitated condition, the house was a bargain for me) Participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence MUST refer to the grammatical subject (the house).** The counter example: Being in a dilapitated condition, I was able to buy the house cheap. (I became dilapitated LOL).
8. **Wrap words getting cut of at the end of line to the next line by dividing it according to formation (know-ledge), or on vowel (propo-sition), or on double letters (refer-ring) unless they form a simple word (tell-ing).**

## Elementary Principles of Composition

9. **Paragraph is the unit of composition. One paragraph per topic.** Single sentences should not be a paragraph. In dialogue, each speech is a paragraph by itself.
10. **(To achieve this, must do that. Blah blah reasons. And so again emphasise that must do that to achieve this) Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning.** In the body of the paragraph, you may include: 
  > - topic sentence clarified by denial of the contrary, 
  > - repeated topic sentence in abridged form, 
  > - topic sentence made clearer, 
  > - definition expanded,
  > - definition explained by contrast,
  > - and supporting reasons.
11. **(I shall backup the database) Use active voice which is more direct and vigorous than the passive.** The counter example: The task of database backup shall be undertaken by me (LOL at all those emails that you receive from your colleagues).
12. **(His performance is not below average) Put statements in positive form.** The right way: His performance is average.
13. **(the question as to whether == whether) Omit needless words.**
14. **Avoid a succession of loose sentences.** If you find a series of sentences monotonous (mechanical, symmetrical), mix them up with
  > - simple sentences,
  > - sentences of two clauses joined by semicolon,
  > - periodic sentences of two clauses,
  > - sentences, loose or periodic, of three clauses.
15. **(Roses are red; violets are blue) Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.** The counter example: Roses are red. Blue violets. Same rule applies to correlative expressions: both-and / not-but / not only-but also / either-or / first-second-third / -and the like.
16. **(Dude, in the middle of a quest, pulled a meme) Keep related words together.** The right way: In the middle of a quest, dude pulled a meme.
17. **Use a single tense in summaries, preferably present tense.** 
  > - Regardless of choice, be consistent. 
  > - If present tense is chosen, antecedent action should be expressed by the perfect tense (e.g. this dude has completed something, instead of this dude completed something). 
  > - Past tense in indirect discourse remains past tense. 
  > - Make clear at the start of the summary that what follows are thoughts or expressions of the author to prevent repeating notification.
18. **(Dude is the carry of his team, because he is good at lane farming) Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.** The right way: Because of his good lane farming skills, dude is the carry of his team. As a rule of thumb, put the punch at the end. This applies to words in a sentence, sentences in a paragraph, paragraphs in a composition.

## Matters of Form

- **Headings.** Leave a line after. Succeeding pages can start on line 1.
- **Numerals.** Do not spell out dates or serial numbers.
- **Parentheses.** Sentence containing the parenthesis is punctuated on the outside, as if the inserted expression do not exist. Expressions in the parentheses has its own punctuations.
- **Quotations.** 
  > Use
  > - Citing documentary evidence are introduced by a colon. 
  > - Quotes in apposition or the direct objects of verbs are introduced by a comma. 
  > 
  > Don't use.
  > - Quotes of entire line should begin on a fresh line, and centered, but NOT enclosed in quotation marks. 
  > - Quotes following keyword **that** do not need quotation marks. 
  > - Proverbial expressions and familiar phrases of literary origin, colloquialisms and slang do not require quotation marks.
- **References.** Abbreviate titles that occur frequently, giving full forms in an alphabetical list at the end. Give references in parenthesis or footnotes.
- **Titles.** Prefers italics with capitalised initials. Omit initial "A" or "The" if you placed the possessive before them (e.g. *The Assasin's Creed* or Ubisoft's *Assasin's Creed*).

## Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

- **All right.** Always two words. May be replaced with "Agreed" or "Go ahead".
- **As to whether.** Replace with "Whether".
- **Case.** Avoid. E.g. in many cases, or this is rarely the case; both (cases) are unnecessary. LOL.
- **Certainly.** Avoid.
- **Character / Nature.** Avoid. Often unnecessary.
- **Claim.** E.g. claimed to be. Not to substitute for "Declare", "Maintain", or "Charge".
- **Compare.** 
  > - Compare to == imply resemblances between objects regarded as of different order. 
  > - Compare with == point out differences between objects regarded as of the same order.
- **Dependable.** A needless substitute for reliable, trustworthy.
- **Due to.** This is tricky. "Due to" should only be used to modify a noun and be preceeded by a form of the verb "to be / is".
  > - Wrong example: The game was cancelled **due to** the rain.
  > - "Due to" does not modify a noun or follows a form of the verb "to be / is".
  > - Correct sentence: The game was cancelled **because of** the rain.
  > - Correct usage: The game's cancellation **was due to** the rain.
  > - If "due to" can be replaced with "attributable to", "caused by", or "resulting from", then it is probably used correctly.
- **Effect.** Do not confuse with "Affect". This term is vague and does not carry much meaning.
- **Etc.** Equivalent to "and the rest", "and so forth". Should only be used if one of these substitutes can be used in place. Should not be at the end of a list beginning with "such as", "for example", or any similar expression.
- **Fact.** Must be directly verifiable.
- **Factor.** Avoid. 
- **Feature.** Avoid.
- **Fix.** Colloquial in America for arrange, prepare, mend. In writing, restrict it to its literary senses, fasten, make firm or immovable, etc.
- **He is a man who.** Avoid.
- **However.** 
  > - If used at the start of sentence or clause it means "in whatever way" or "to whatever extent".
  > - *However you advise him, he will probably do as he likes.*
  > - If used at between related clauses it means "nevertheless".
- **Kind of / Sort of.** Avoid in writing. Use "rather", "something like".
- **Less / Fewer.** Less refers to quantity. Fewer refers to number.
  > - His worries are less than mine == His worries are not as great as mine.
  > - His worries are fewer than mine == His worries are not as numerous as mine.
- **Along this lines.** Avoid.
- **Literal / Literally.** Often incorrectly abused to support exaggeration. Avoid. Use "Almost".
- **Lose out.** Just use "lose". The two words do not form idiomatic combinations, like "find out".
- **Near by.** Avoid. Use "near", "near at hand", or "neighbouring".
- **Oftentimes.** Avoid. Use often.
- **One of the most.** Avoid. Does not carry much impact.
- **People.** this is a political term. Not to be confused with public. Not to be used with words of number, in place of persons.
- **Phase.** Means "stage of transition". Not to be confused with "point", "topic", or "aspect".
- **Possess.** Not to be used as mere substitute for "have" or "own".
- **Respective / Respectively.** Often redundant and may usually be omitted.
- **So.** Avoid using it as an intensifier, "so good", "so bad", etc.
- **State.** Avoid substituting it for "say" or "remark". Used to express fully or clearly.
- **A member of the student body.** Avoid. Needless.
- **System.** In non-technical writing, often used without need.
- **Thanking you in advance.** Avoid. Sounds like the next response letter of thank is not worth your effort.
- **They.** Do not use it as a plural pronoun when the antecedent is "each", "each one", "everybody", "every one", "anybody", "any one", "somebody", "some one".
- **Very.** Use sparingly.
- **Viewpoint.** Use "view" or "opinion" or "point of view".
- **While.** Strictly used to describe "during the time that" something is occurring. Do not use it to substitute for "and", "but", and "although". Connection can be replaced by a semicolon.
- **Whom.** Avoid. Often used incorrectly in place of "who" or "that".
- **Worth while.** Avoid. Only applicable to actions. Do not follow with a noun.
- **Would.** Do not use in place of should. Can often be dropped when expressing habitual or repeated actions.
